# 1: Code Refactor

Hi! I'm Val Brisendine and I am a new developer out of Dallas. 
Below is an assignment practicing Refactoring. This assignment was done with HTML and CSS only. 

# Horiseon. - Refactoring an existing site.
(This site is to provide information on web presence) 

This assignment was to help hone my skills with refactoring existing code. Though I did not build it, I was tasked to clean up, consolidate, and make it more accessible.
This assignment was purly to practice HTML and CSS semantics, and to appy my knowledge so far in refactoring code.
I was able to cosolodate quite a bit of the code and to make it more accessible. I also made some alterations to the divs along with helpful comments to help its readability.
I learned to keep code clean and to notate with comments effectivly to allow easier browsing. I learned that as a developer, considering how people view your content as well as your code is very important.
